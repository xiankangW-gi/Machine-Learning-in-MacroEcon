Use Deep Learning Method to Solve Dynamic Macroeconomics Model

Since the current mainstream deep learning framework has changed from TensorFlow to Pytorch, I use Pytorch to reproduce the results of the Deep Equilibrium Nets(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3393482).

The code can run on Colab(https://colab.google/)
